Welcome to my GitHub account! I'm an aspiring DevOps Engineer starting my journey in Linux and Azure DevOps. This repository tracks my progress as I learn these technologies.

## Current Focus

- Exploring Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines and version control.
- Studying Git and GitHub for collaboration.

## Goals
- Practice Linux commands in a virtual environment.
- Set up a basic Azure DevOps project.
- Contribute to open-source DevOps projects in the future.

Feel free to check back as I update this repo with new notes and projects!
